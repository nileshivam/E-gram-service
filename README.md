Created a new web platform for E-gram service using laravel framework of PHP during "Code for gujarat HakcAThon" organized by GTU with unique feature of Digital Signature, SMS service and Android application. 
Villagers have to travel too long to issue or update the Certificates like Birth Certificate etc.So, E-gram service was introduced in which in every village there is a E-gram centre and now villagers only need to go to that centre and do required things. but still there are physical movement of documents which take too much time So we have created a web platform that only online movement of the documents are taken place and the had a feature of digital signature by the authorized person, the record of the document will in the history so in case of lost it can be villagers can get the other one.
